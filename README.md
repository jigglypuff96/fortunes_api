# fortunes_api

npm init -y
When should you npm init ? Most developers run npm init right after creating and navigating into a new project. It makes sense to npm init at the start of the project because we use npm to download dependencies. Once we npm init , we can begin downloading (and saving) our dependencies.

npm i nodemon --save-dev

npm i express --save

For the API, we will be sending back different json objects that represent fortunes based on the user's request. To collect all these various fortunes, we will store them in a json file. data/fortune.json (javascript object notation - contains javascript object or array. We surround our object keys with strings)
